### Scope

#### Content Requirements
A mobile-first approach is taken to ensure optimal performance on mobile devices and the Bootstrap 5 size limits will be considered during the design of each section in order to make it suitable for phones, tablets, and desktops.

##### Section: Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar will be present on every page to create a cohesive structure across the website.
- It will include the site name and logo, so that the website is easily identifiable.
- It will have links to the homepage, how to play page, and contact me page.
- The links will be responsive to a mouse hover and click to provide feedback to the user.
- The current page will have its link identified in some way to indicate the current page.

##### Section: Footer
- The footer section will be present on every page to create a cohesive structure across the website.
- It will include the site name and logo, so that the website is easily identifiable.
- It will include external links such as a link to the developer's GitHub profile.
- External links will be responsive to a mouse hover and click to provide feedback to the user.
- External links will open in a new tab to provide good user experience.

##### Webpage: Homepage
- The homepage will house the memory game.

##### Webpage: How to play
- The how to play page will provide instructions to the user.

##### Webpage: Contact me
- The contact me page will house a text box, allowing the user to send a message to the developer's email using an API.

### Structure

#### Overall Structure
Each page will consist of:
- **Navigation bar**: Meets the navigation requirement.
- **Main section**: Meeting the page-specific requirements.

Required pages and their main sections:
- **Homepage**: This page will meet the requirement for an interactive game.
    1. The main section of the homepage will hold the game area.
    2. The game area will have the following functionality:
        - The user can select a number of cards to memorise.
        - The cards will then be shuffled.
        - The shuffled cards will be displayed to the user.
        - The amount of shuffled cards will be displayed to the user.
        - The shuffled cards will then be hidden and the user must recreate the sequence.
        - The user will be informed of their final score.
- **How to play**
        - Click on a card to flip it over and reveal    its   symbol.
        Click on a second card to flip it over and reveal its symbol.
        If the two cards match, they remain face-up.
        If the two cards do not match, they are flipped back face-down after a short delay.
         Continue flipping cards to find all the matching pairs.
        The game ends when all pairs are found and all cards are face-up.

#### Information Architecture
The same navigation bar and footer will be implemented on each page to create a consistent website that is pleasing to look at and easy to use.
The navigation bar will have the site brand/logo that links to the homepage as well as separate links to the other pages. This will allow the user to access the desired section of the site well within the 3 click maximum that many websites adhere to.
There will be no sub-category navigation links within each webpage.

#### Interactive Experience
- **The website**: Clickable links will have animated effects on hover or click, providing clear feedback to the user. All external links such as the GitHub profile will open in a new tab. Content hinting will be used where possible to influence the user to scroll down and uncover new content on the pages.
- **The game**: 
    - The game will work by firstly having the user select the level of expectise. 
    - When settings button is clicked, the user will then choose their level from 3 different levels.
    - Click on Reset button to begin the game.
    - There will be feedback on score and congratulations message.

#### Changes during development
The decision was taken to after reviews from tutor. So I added an instruction and settings page to help change it from just a 0ne page website.

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](docs/Game.png)

As can be seen the chosen colours provide adequate contrast in line with the accessibility criteria for the webpage. The chosen colours are:


#### Typography
I researched clear legible typefaces that will enhance the user experience of the site and picked one for the navigation bar and titles, one for the button and table text, and one for blocks of text. They were used in this regard across the website to acheive a consistent brand.

#### Images


#### How To Play

- Clicking the how to play link in the header opens up the how to play modal.
- It is bordered in the shape of a playing card to continue the theme of the game.
- It has the inverted colour scheme to the how to play link, relating them in the user's mind.
- It provides the user with information on how to play the game in a concise and fun way.
