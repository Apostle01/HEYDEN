# Testing Guide for Hayden Memory Card Game

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategies, tools, and procedures for the Hayden Memory Card Game. The goal is to ensure the game functions correctly, provides a smooth user experience, and is free from defects.

## Testing Strategies

### Automated Testing
Automated tests will be used to ensure the core functionality of the game, such as card matching, score calculation, and timer functions. These tests will run automatically to quickly identify regressions or issues.

### Manual Testing
Manual testing will focus on the user interface, game flow, and user experience. Testers will manually interact with the game to identify any issues that automated tests might miss.

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing Tools
- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests of JavaScript functions.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing of the game flow and user interactions.

### Manual Testing Tools
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting and debugging the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Test Plan and Checklist**: Documented in this guide for structured manual testing.

## Setup Instructions

### Automated Testing Setup
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

### Manual Testing Setup
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Ensure the browser console is open to monitor any errors or warnings.

## Running Tests

### Automated Tests
- To run unit tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```
- To run end-to-end tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

### Manual Tests
1. **Functional Testing**:
    - Verify that clicking on a card flips it.
    - Verify that matching cards remain flipped and increase the score.
    - Verify that non-matching cards flip back over.
    - Verify that the score is updated correctly.
    - Verify that the timer counts down from 60 seconds.
    - Verify that pausing the game stops the timer and prevents card flips.
    - Verify that resetting the game resets the score and timer, and shuffles the cards.
    - Verify that exiting the game navigates to the main menu.

2. **User Interface Testing**:
    - Ensure the game layout is responsive and elements are correctly aligned.
    - Check for any visual glitches or misaligned elements.
    - Verify the accessibility of the game (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

3. **Usability Testing**:
    - Play the game to ensure it is enjoyable and intuitive.
    - Gather feedback from different users about their experience.

## Test Cases

### Example Automated Test Case
```javascript
test('should match two cards and update score', () => {
    // Arrange: Set up initial game state
    const game = new MemoryGame();
    game.start();
    const card1 = game.cards[0];
    const card2 = game.cards[1];
    
    // Act: Simulate flipping two matching cards
    game.flipCard(card1);
    game.flipCard(card2);
    
    // Assert: Verify the score is updated
    expect(game.score).toBe(1);
    expect(card1.isFlipped).toBe(true);
    expect(card2.isFlipped).toBe(true);
});
Example Manual Test Case
Test Case ID: TC001
Test Description: Verify that clicking on a card flips it over.
Preconditions: Game is loaded and displayed.
Test Steps:
Click on any card.
Expected Result: The card flips over and reveals the emoji/image.
Actual Result: (To be filled during testing)
Status: Pass/Fail
Continuous Integration
Automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The configuration is stored in .github/workflows/test.yml and runs the tests on every push and pull request.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue: Tests fail with timeout errors.
Solution: Increase the timeout value in the test configuration.
Log Files
Log files for test runs are stored in the logs/ directory.

Contributing
Please follow the coding standards outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md when writing new tests. Ensure all new features have corresponding unit and integration tests.
