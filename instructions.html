            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its symbol.</li>
                <li>Click on a second card to flip it over and reveal its symbol.</li>
                <li>If the two cards match, they remain face-up.</li>
                <li>If the two cards do not match, they are flipped back face-down after a short delay.</li>

                <li>The game ends when all pairs are found and all cards are face-up.</li>
